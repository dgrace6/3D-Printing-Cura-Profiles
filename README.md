# 3D-Printing-Cura-Profiles
Profiles for different types of filament for a jump off point. Some minor adjustments may be needed for different printers

Welcome to the KSU Research 3D Printing Github! Here we have profiles for specific filaments to help set a baseline to start new prints. 

If there is a , before a number i.e. ,8mm nozzle, that means .8mm for file reading reasons. If there are no numbers in the name of a profile file, the default is for .4mm nozzle, which most printers will have on it already. 

Feel free to add any profiles by submitting a pull request!
